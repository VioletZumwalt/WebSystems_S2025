I will say that, though I detest ChatGPT, it was a good reference for this homework assignment, as I do not think I have done much in the log before.

However, just using what ChatGPT gave me would have been dishonest. It gave me the foundation to go look into what these things are, and what I am doing with them.

Also it gave me white as a background color, that was boring.

I don't think I wrote it out the most clean, and my comments do not feel the most useful, but it gets the job done.

An example of the way that ChatGPT is a tool and not an artistic medium.
