ChatGPT's iteration of this project was helpful in understanding what the code meant, and what was being asked of me. However, it's actual writing was bland, simplistic, and didn't make sense.
I used it as a reference for my own code structure, as the lesson was somewhat confusing in how it all connected. 
This was a good exercise in using ChatGPT as a TOOL and not a creative item


The assignment took multiple runs, and multiple times, things would break. Certain code lines would stop the rest from working, or cut off a tree into another one. 
For example, I couldn't get the Stay function to work, unless it was all in the same branch, rather messily.
The images took a bit of troubleshooting, getting the sizing right and the webps to work with me.
I did get it to work though!
