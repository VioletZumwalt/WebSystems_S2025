Website presents as a simple visual novel with a dark background
Code keeps track of different "tones" that the player may use in dialogue, tones allow for voices to pop up or leave.
Voices are limited at this time, but presents itself with different colored text.
Top left is a tone tracker, for playtesting, allowing the player to keep track. 6 of a specific tone leads to that voice popping up (though not all are currently possible)
At the bottom are introduction triggers, for playtesting, allowing the player to just trigger an intro so future dialogue from that voice can be triggered.
