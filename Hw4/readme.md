ChatGPT's iteration of this project was helpful in understanding what the code meant, especially after realizing I did last week's assignment using this week's tools. That greatly explained my disconnect last week.
ChatGPT still cannot do a decent story, but it can do decent code.
Once again, a reminder that it is a decent tool, not a creative device.
