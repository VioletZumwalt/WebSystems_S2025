            <h2>A Memorable Gaming Experience</h2>
            <p>
                Once, when I was younger, I ran a DND game that was centered around a homebrewed plotline. I had told my players off the bat that I was going to lie to them, that the focus was figuring out who was lying and when. That it wasn't combat. </br>
                They did not listen to this statement, and never once tried to figure out who was lying and when. They attacked people wildly. </br>
                In the end, they ended up being TPKed because one trusted a mindflayer willingly, and it very quickly wiped out the party. </br>
                That room was intended as a stealth section. </br>
                They never wanted to play dnd with me again.

            <h3>What Made It Special</h3>
            <p>How does one completely ignore the warnings a DM gives, and then gets mad when the warnings were correct? One that I do not know, but it's very funny never being spoken to again because they refused to listen!</p>

            <h3>Why are games important</h3>
            <p>Even when a player is being completely silly in a situation like this, games like these are important because they're distractions from current issues, such as politics!</br>
            Thank goodness we haven't had any major political situations happen within the last few days that causes a need for this distraction, haha!</br>
            It helps having something to fall back to as a comfort and escapism, and a way to bond with people, even if it goes poorly like that DND session</p>
