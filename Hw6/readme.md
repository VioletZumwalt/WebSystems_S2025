This week was incredibly frustrating. I can't seem to get it to fetch the playerdata, in any iteration i do. 
I tried going to multiple sources to help me figure out what I was missing, ai and otherwise,
I tried youtube as well. I don't seem to understand how to make this work...

Updated notes, This works in Edge, but not Firefox. I can't decipher why it works in one and not the other, but it works!
Definitely a challenge and a half, I'm not butting heads with Firefox at this point, though. Yay, I made a funcitonal silly little game.
